# Direct Deposit Module for Maker

The Direct Deposit Module interfaces with third party lending protocols to enable a maximum variable borrow rate for selected assets. Maker Governance is able to pick a target variable borrow rate, and the module will automatically deposit/remove liquidity to ensure that target rate is hit.
